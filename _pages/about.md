Since 2014, Dr. Fangyi Zhang has specialized in robotics and machine learning, establishing a robust record of publications and demonstrating leadership in both research and engagement. He has authored over 20 peer-reviewed publications, including contributions to top conferences and journals in robotics (IJRR, RA-L, ICRA, IROS) and machine learning (NeurIPS, ICLR). His academic excellence has been recognized with several awards, including a Best Paper Award Finalist at ACRA 2017 and a Best Industry Paper at IJCAIW 2021.

Dr. Fangyi Zhang is currently a research fellow in the [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/). He completed his PhD at the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV)](https://www.roboticvision.org/) at QUT node, under the supervision of [Prof. Peter Corke](https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Peter+Corke), [Dr. JÃ¼rgen Leitner](http://juxi.net/), and [Prof. Michael Milford](https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Michael+Milford). His PhD research, which he completed in 2018, focused on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Transfer Learning for Robotic Reaching, and his thesis was titled ["Learning Real-world Visuo-motor Policies from Simulation"](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/121471/). Following his PhD, he joined [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) as an Algorithm Expert, where he worked on drone applications and data mining. His current research interests include robot learning, tactile sensing, robotic vision, robotic manipulation, and autonomous systems.

Before pursuing his PhD, Dr. Zhang earned his B.Eng. degree in Automation from East China Jiaotong University in 2010. He then spent three years working on R&D of locomotive control algorithms and electrical systems at the [CRRC Zhuzhou Institute](https://www.crrcgc.cc/zzsen/47_2774/47_2807/index.html) from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, he was a research assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Ming Liu](https://ram-lab.com/people/#dr-ming-liu-director), where he conducted research on VLC-based indoor localization and 2D-laser based 3D sensing.
