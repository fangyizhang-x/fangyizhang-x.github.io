title: VLC-Based Indoor Localization
description: This is a project I worked on with Prof. Ming Liu and Mr. Kejie Qiu when I was a research assistant in the RAM-LAB at HKUST. Contributions":" Developed a beacon code selection algorithm and a decomposition algorithm for blindly mixed beacon signals, based on CDMA code selection principles and Gold-sequence correlation properties.
