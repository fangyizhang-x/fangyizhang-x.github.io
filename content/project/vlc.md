This is a project I worked on with [Prof. Ming Liu](http://www.ece.ust.hk/ece.php/profile/facultydetail/eelium) and [Mr. Kejie Qiu](https://sites.google.com/site/kejieqiujack/) when I was a research assistant in the [RAM-LAB](https://ram-lab.com/research/#visible-light-communication-based-localization-and-path-planning) at [HKUST](http://www.ust.hk/).

Contributions:

- Developed a beacon code selection algorithm and a decomposition algorithm for blindly mixed beacon signals, based on CDMA code selection principles and Gold-sequence correlation properties.
- Participated in the development of a light intensity distribution map generation algorithm using Gaussian Process Regression.
- Participated in the development of localization and path planning algorithms using Kalman Filter (KF) and A star.
