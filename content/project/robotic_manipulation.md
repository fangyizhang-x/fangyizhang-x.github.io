- ### **Amazon Picking Challenge (2016)**
As part of the [Team ACRV](https://research.qut.edu.au/ras/research/amazon-picking-challenge-2016/) for the [Amazon Picking Challenge 2016](http://pwurman.org/amazonpickingchallenge/results.shtml), I worked on hand-eye calibration with [Dr. Leo Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/wuliaothu/home).

- ### **Household Applications**
This is a project I worked on during my visit to the [Perception and Robotics Group](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), College Park, Sep-Dec 2016. A mobile manipulation robot was developed for housework in a kitchen scenario, where I mainly took charge of the sub-task of table cleaning. Thanks to [Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/), [Dr. Cornelia Ferm√ºller](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/), [Dr. Yi Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~yili/), [Dr. Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/) and my colleagues: [Dr. Fang Wang](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~fwang/), Dr. Ren Mao, [Dr. Aleksandrs Ecins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDDJ48UAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Wentao Luan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PJQ8XgwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Mr. Konstantinos Zampogiannis](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~kzampog/), Mr. Yi Zhang, [Mr. Kanishka Ganguly](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~kganguly/), [Mr. Chethan M Parameshwara](https://analogicalnexus.github.io/).
