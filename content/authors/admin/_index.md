Dr. Fangyi Zhang is currently a research fellow in the [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/). He was also a former PhD student in the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV)](https://www.roboticvision.org/) at QUT node, supervised by [Prof. Peter Corke](https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Peter+Corke), [Dr. Jürgen Leitner](http://juxi.net/), [Prof. Michael Milford](https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Michael+Milford) and [Dr. Ben Upcroft](https://www.roboticvision.org/rv_person/ben-upcroft/). His PhD research was focused on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Transfer Learning for Robotic Reaching, and obtained the degree in 2018 with the thesis entitled ["Learning Real-world Visuo-motor Policies from Simulation"](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/121471/). After that, he joined [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) as a Research Scientist, doing research and development work on drone applications and data mining. His current research interests include robot learning, robotic vision, robotic manipulation, and autonomous systems.

Prior to his PhD, Fangyi obtained his B.Eng. degree in Automation from the East China Jiaotong University in 2010, followed with three years' work experience on R&D of locomotive control algorithms and electrical systems in the [CRRC Zhuzhou Institute](https://www.crrcgc.cc/zzsen/g2807.aspx) from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, he stayed for one year at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, as a research assistant supervised by [Prof. Ming Liu](https://ram-lab.com/people/#dr-ming-liu-director), doing research on VLC-based indoor localization and 2D-laser based 3D sensing.

<!-- Details regarding his research prior his Ph.D. can be found on the page https://sites.google.com/site/fangyifanleyzhang/research. -->

<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
