      <description>Amazon Picking Challenge (2016)   As part of the Team ACRV for the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016, I worked on hand-eye calibration with Dr. Leo Wu.     Household Applications   This is a project I worked on during my visit to the Perception and Robotics Group at the University of Maryland, College Park, Sep-Dec 2016. A mobile manipulation robot was developed for housework in a kitchen scenario, where I mainly took charge of the sub-task of table cleaning.</description>

      <description>This is a project I worked on with Prof. Ming Liu and Mr. Kejie Qiu when I was a research assistant in the RAM-LAB at HKUST.
  Contributions:
 Developed a beacon code selection algorithm and a decomposition algorithm for blindly mixed beacon signals, based on CDMA code selection principles and Gold-sequence correlation properties. Participated in the development of a light intensity distribution map generation algorithm using Gaussian Process Regression.</description>
